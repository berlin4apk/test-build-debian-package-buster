edk2 (0~20121205.edae8d2d-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the package section and debian/copyright: the FAT driver has a
    license addendum which makes it non-free instead of BSD.
    Closes: #714322.
  * Make our build friendlier to git checkouts, by making sure our target
    dir exists before copying.
